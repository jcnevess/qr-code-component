### Built with
- HTML, CSS;
- eleventy.js;

### What I learnedhttps://github.com/jcnevess/qr-code-component
This was my first time using `min-content` to set the width. It was very helpful to make the container div the size of the image, which is fixed.
```css 
.card {
  ...
  width: min-content;
  ...
}
```

This was also my first time using `object-fit` to align images.
```css
.card__image img {
  object-fit: fill;
}
```
